		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<section title="Overview">
			<p>
				The International Flag of Earth - Image Generator overlays the "International 
				Flag of Planet Earth" onto any image. The interface consists of a preview image, 
				controls to modify the composite, and buttons to save the final image. The controls 
				are grouped into three sections <a href="#background">Background</a>, 
				<a href="#settings">Settings</a>, and <a href="#options">Options</a> to indicate 
				the type manipulation the control represents.
			</p>
			<p>
				Use the "Update" button at the bottom of the interface to update the preview image 
				after adjusting the controls. The image is generated with the device's processor 
				(e.g. phone, computer, tablet, etc.) and may take some time with large images 
				(2MB+). When the preview has finished updating, the browser will automatically 
				scroll it into view.
			</p>
		</section>
		<h2>Background<a id="background"></a></h2>
		<section title="Background">
			<p>
				Use the file selection input to open the image selection dialog. Alternatively, 
				tap or click the preview image to open the image selection dialog. Select an 
				image from those available on your device, or other connected sources (e.g. 
				camera, external media, cloud storage, etc.).
			</p>
			<p>
				Once selected, the image will immediately load into memory and update the preview. 
				This initial load may take some time for large images (2MB+). If no controls have 
				been previously modified, a default composite configuration will be applied when 
				the initial image is selected.
			</p>
		</section>
		<h2>Settings<a id="settings"></a></h2>
		<section title="Settings">
			<p>
				The controls in this section contain multiple selections or allow varying degrees 
				of one parameter to be set. Adjust the controls to produce the desired composite 
				image. Use the "Update" button at the bottom of the interface to update the preview 
				image and view the adjustment.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><h3>Blend Mode</h3>
					Use this control to select the blend mode for the overlay. Each mode will produce 
					a dramatically different effect when the background is blended with the overlay. 
					Several standard image blend modes are implemented to provide a wide range of 
					creative possibilities. More information about how image blend modes affect the 
					composite can be found at: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes">Wikipedia: 
					Blend modes</a>
				</li>
				<li><h3>Overlay Scale</h3>
					This control affects the relative size of the overlay. 100% will scale the overlay 
					to the size of the largest possible square within the composite image (the lesser 
					of height or width, aspect ratio preserved). A lower percentage will reduce the 
					size of the overlay, while a larger percentage will scale the overlay beyond the 
					borders of the composite.  The blue matte will be extended or reduced to cover the 
					background image when necessary.
				</li>
				<li><h3>Overlay Opacity</h3>
					Transparency can be achieved by setting the opacity of the overlay to a value 
					less than 100%. Many of the blend modes alter the composite in intense ways 
					which may be undesirable when applied with a fully opaque overlay. Use the 
					opacity control to creatively tame this intensity... or apply deliberately.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<h2>Options<a id="options"></a></h2>
		<section title="Options">
			<p>
				The controls in this section are binary or can only be applied exclusively. Enable or 
				disable options with the radio buttons and checkboxes to produce the desired composite 
				image. Use the "Update" button at the bottom of the interface to update the preview image 
				and view the adjustment.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><h3>Fit Image</h3>
					To fit the overlay to the selected background image, depress this radio button. 
					The dimensions of the selected background image will be used as the dimensions of 
					the composite image. This also significantly reduces the effect of the "Smoothing" 
					option, as the background image will not be scaled. The "900px &middot; 600px" radio button 
					will raise.
				</li>
				<li><h3>900px &middot; 600px</h3>
					To set the composite image width to 900 pixels and its height to 600 pixels, depress 
					this radio button. The selected background image will be scaled to fit this size (aspect 
					ratio preserved). These dimensions are grandfathered from 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Earth#/media/File:International_Flag_of_Planet_Earth.svg">the 
					source image on Wikipedia</a> (used to create this application) and reflect the 3 x 2 ratio of the original flag 
					design. The "Fit Image" radio button will raise.
				</li>
				<li><h3>Smoothing</h3>
					Toggle this checkbox to enable or disable smoothing of the background image. With no 
					smoothing applied, the square edges of the pixels will be preserved producing a generally 
					sharper image. With smoothing applied, the background image will be interpolated as it's 
					scaled to the to the dimensions of the composite. This reduces the appearance of sharp 
					edges and smooths the transitions between colors in the background image.
				</li>
				<li><h3>Blue Matte</h3>
					Toggle this checkbox to enable or disable the blue background elements of the overlay. 
					When disabled, only the flower will be drawn (in white) and may be creatively transformed with blend 
					modes. Due to the computations involved in some of these modes, white may not modify the 
					image when blended (e.g. Multiply, Darken).
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<h2>Saving<a id="saving"></a></h2>
		<section title="Saving">
			<p>
				After updating the preview image, the composite image may be saved to your device with the 
				"Save" button. With relatively small images (e.g. avatars, profile pictures, etc.) this may 
				be sufficient. Due to browser restrictions, large images (2MB+) may not be able to be saved. 
				To mitigate this inconvenience, cloud storage providers can be used to receive the image from 
				the browser as an upload.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><h3>Dropbox</h3>
					Tap or click the black Dropbox logo to connect the application to your Dropbox account. 
					You will be prompted to login and grant "iFlag of Earth - Image Generator" permission to 
					write files into an application folder ("Apps/B82 - iFlag of Earth") in your Dropbox. 
					Once you have preformed this, Dropbox will return you to the application. The Dropbox logo 
					will be full-color (indicating the connection), and tapping or clicking the "Save" button 
					will now upload the composite image to Dropbox.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				To return the "Save" button to its original function (save image to device), simply tap or 
				click the connected (full-color) cloud storage provider logo to disable the connection.
			</p>
		</section>
		<h2>Notes<a id="notes"></a></h2>
		<section title="Notes">
			<p>
				<i>Processing</i><br/>
				All processing happens in-browser. Images are never uploaded to a server for processing. 
				The time required to generate the composite image is dependent on the processing speed 
				of the device.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Cloud Storage</i><br/>
				At your discretion, the composite image may be uploaded to a cloud storage provider. 
				The time required to upload the composite image is dependent on the speed of the device's 
				Internet connection. Please be aware of any applicable charges that may be accrued during 
				this data transfer.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Browser Compatibility</i>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Firefox</b> - all operations complete as expected
				</li>
				<li><b>Safari</b> - when saving to device, will open the composite image as a data url... use "Save As..." 
					functionality to save image
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Chrome</b> - will not save large composite images to the device and will fail silently - no 
					error or notification... use cloud storage
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Internet Explorer</b> - will not save large composite images to the device and will fail silently 
					- no error or notification... use cloud storage
				</li>
